18.5,W,"Natarajan to Karthik, OUTtickled behind to the keeper and that's it for Karthik! He made room by backing away, the ball was well outside off and his swing only resulted in an edge for the keeper. What a knock from a man who is ready to retire, and almost kept RCB in the game right till the end",Dinesh Karthik c †Klaasen b Natarajan 83 (35b 5x4 7x6 52m) SR: 237.14
14.1,W,"Cummins to Lomror, OUTchopped on and Cummins has got them a breakthrough again! Short ball with no room at all, rising on off stump as he rolls his fingers over it, and Lomror slices it with an inside edge onto his stumps. The crowd has gone silent again",Mahipal Lomror b Cummins 19 (11b 0x4 2x6 23m) SR: 172.72
9.6,W,"Cummins to Chauhan, OUTgone first ball! Second wicket in the over for Cummins and he is pushing RCB's hopes down a hill. Around the wicket to the left-hand batter and that was quick at 146kmh, and hit him full on the pads right in front of the stumps. The umpire raised his finger in slow motion as soon as they appealed",Saurav Chauhan lbw b Cummins 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 6m) SR: 0
9.3,W,"Cummins to du Plessis, OUTtickled through to the keeper and the captain is gone! RCB are crumbling here all of a sudden. It was a slow bouncer which du PLessies tried to put away as the ball went over him, but all he managed was a thin edge",Faf du Plessis c †Klaasen b Cummins 62 (28b 7x4 4x6 40m) SR: 221.42
8.6,W,"Markande to Patidar, OUTholes out while attempting another big one! Pitched up on middle with some drift, Patidar swings big on the leg side towards the longest part of the boundary and he finds Nitish Reddy placed in between deep midwicket and long-on. Caught right at the rope",Rajat Patidar c Nitish Kumar Reddy b Markande 9 (5b 0x4 1x6 3m) SR: 180
7.6,W,"Unadkat to du Plessis, OUTdrilled back and Jacks is outside his crease while the bails have gone off after a deflection! Jacks might be kicking himself for that. Du Plessis hit it straight back, it went off Unadkat's right hand as he went down and got just enough to deflect it to the stumps",Will Jacks run out (Unadkat) 7 (4b 1x4 0x6 7m) SR: 175
6.2,W,"Markande to Kohli, OUTKohli has been castled! Chinnaswamy has been silenced because Markande has beaten the top-scorer of this IPL with some skill. Slows that down beautifully to 83.7kmh, it's a googly too, and Kohli goes for a sweep with hard hands but he misses it completely and looks back in horror",Virat Kohli b Markande 42 (20b 6x4 2x6 26m) SR: 210
