16.6,W,"Ferguson to Klaasen, OUTwide full-toss, and looped to point! A tame end, but what an innings! Pace off from Ferguson, had he left it it might have been called as a wide. But  he rightly wanted to place bat on ball at every opportunity. RCB finally have a third wicket!",Heinrich Klaasen c Vyshak b Ferguson 67 (31b 2x4 7x6 46m) SR: 216.12
12.3,W,"Ferguson to Head, OUTstraight up in the air, du Plessis calls early and Head is gone! Made toom to leg again, Ferguson followed him into the blockhole, cramping the swing of his bat. A steepler to mid-off, but no mistake from the skipper. What a knock that was!",Travis Head c du Plessis b Ferguson 102 (41b 9x4 8x6 58m) SR: 248.78
8.1,W,"Topley to Abhishek, OUTwhipped off the toes, out to deep square leg.... and finally a wicket for RCB! Topley in the wickets after that bruising first over. Abhishek couldn't make proper contact on his clip... but is this respite? Is it heck. Here's Heinrich!",Abhishek Sharma c Ferguson b Topley 34 (22b 2x4 2x6 34m) SR: 154.54
